Installing Viscid
*****************

`Viscid <https://viscid-hub.github.io/Viscid-docs/docs/dev/>`_ is a visualization suite that was developed by a graduate student at UNH. It understands PSC HDF5 field data and is the easiest way to read and plot data.


For installation instructions, please look here: https://viscid-hub.github.io/Viscid-docs/docs/dev/installation.html

.. note::

   The stable (``master``) version of ``Viscid`` gives errors after recent updates to `matplotlib`. Therefore, I had to use the development version of ``Viscid`` which fixes those issues. Unfortunately, that meant I had to install from source.
