# Test Cases

* t001_ot: Ideal MHD Orszag-Tang vortex with ggcm_mhd_step c3_double

* t002_kh: Ideal MHD Kelvin Helmholtz test with ggcm_mhd_step c3_double

* t003_ic_mirdip: Test the "mirdip" initial condition on staggered B
  grid. This tests bnd_sphere and bnd_inoutflow to some extent, too.

* t004_ic_mirdip: Test the "mirdip" initial condition all cell
  centered grid. This tests bnd_sphere and bnd_inoutflow to some
  extent, too.

* t005_ic_mirdip: Test the "mirdip" initial condition on
  ggcm-staggered B grid. This tests bnd_sphere and bnd_inoutflow to
  some extent, too.

* t006_alfven_wing: Ganymede-based Alfven wing test without dipole
  field.

* t007_cpaw_mhd: MHD-based circular polarized Alfven wave test, 1d,
  Jimmy-MHD staggered scheme

* t008_cpaw_mhd: MHD-based circular polarized Alfven wave test, 1d,
  cell-centered scheme
