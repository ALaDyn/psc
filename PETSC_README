Current Status and notes on Petsc integration:

Building:
1) Petsc >= 3.4.0 required (the build system will enforce this)
2) I recommend using a petsc built in your home directory.
   System installed petsc's have some issues.
3) I also recommend using a petsc-arch, archless petsc builds have problems.
4) The build system defaults to no petsc, so use a --with-petsc flag to enable it
5) If --with-petsc is given without an argument the value of the envionment PETSC_DIR will be used.
6) If --with-petsc-arch is not given or given without an argument the value of PETSC_ARCH will be used.
7) If you really, really want to use an arch-less petsc give --without-petsc-arch

Running and writing
mrc_vec_petsc will automatically replace whatever mrc_vec datatype matches PetscScalar.
PetscInitialize must be called instead of MPI_Init.
Petsc just allocates space for vectors right now, nothing fancy.
